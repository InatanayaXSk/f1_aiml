# 1. Introduction

The Formula 1 racing landscape is on the brink of a major transformation with the upcoming 2026 Technical Regulations. These changes represent a fundamental shift in how power is generated, aerodynamics are managed, and competition is balanced. Unlike previous regulatory shifts, the 2026 package simultaneously overhauls the internal combustion engine requirements, the electrical energy recovery systems, and the aerodynamic philosophy of the cars.

This project, the **F1 2026 Regulation Impact Simulator**, serves as a predictive bridge between the current "Ground Effect" era (2022-2025) and the future 2026 framework. As summarized in our `src` and `notebooks` directories, it is an advanced analytical tool designed to quantify and visualize these changes using a data-driven approach. By leveraging high-fidelity historical race data sourced via the **FastF1 API**, we have developed a machine learning-powered simulation engine that models the performance of 32 unique drivers and 10 teams across 26 global circuits.

The workflow of the project, detailed across our four primary directories, is strictly sequential to ensure data integrity. First, comprehensive Python notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory must be executed to prepare the data, engineer the 25-feature matrix, and train the predictive **XGBoost** models. Once these datasets are generated and saved as JSON artifacts, a modern React/Vite frontend dashboard, documented in the `frontend/` directory, provides users with interactive visualizations of the simulator's outputs. This report details the methodology, technical implementation, and key insights derived from this simulation project, demonstrating how machine learning can navigate the deep uncertainties of professional motorsport.
