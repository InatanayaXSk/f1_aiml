# 3. Objectives

## 3.1 Primary Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust, end-to-end simulation framework capable of projecting the impact of 2026 F1 regulations on race outcomes with high statistical confidence. The specific technical goals, distributed across our `src` and `notebooks` modules, are:
*   **Performance Modeling**: Train a high-performance **XGBoost regressor** (implemented in `03_monte_carlo_sim.ipynb`) on four seasons of race data (2022-2025) to understand the baseline factors that drive race finishing positions in the current aerodynamic era.
*   **Regulation Transformation**: Implement a mathematical transformation layer (`regulation_transform.py`) that applies projected technical multipliers (Electric: 3.33x, Aero: 0.70x, Weight: 0.962x) to historical performance features, effectively "moving" a performance profile into a 2026 technical context.
*   **Uncertainty Quantification**: Utilize a **Monte Carlo Engine** (defined in `monte_carlo.py`) to run 2,000 simulations per race, generating a probability density function for each driver’s finishing position rather than a single deterministic value.

## 3.2 Secondary Objectives

Supporting the core simulation are several architectural objectives identified in our directory summaries:
*   **Automated Data Pipeline**: Build a seamless retrieval system using the `data_loader.py` module and the **FastF1 API** to extract lap-by-lap timing, telemetry, and weather data, supported by a local CSV caching mechanism to optimize repeated runs.
*   **High-Dimensional Feature Engineering**: Derive a specialized matrix of 25 features via `features.py`, including rolling driver form (5-race window), team consistency scores, and track-specific indices like straight-line fraction and overtaking difficulty (generated by `s_frontend/pathGen.py`).
*   **Visual Analytics Dashboard**: Create a suite of interactive React dashboards (located in `frontend/`) that allow users to compare "Current vs. 2026" distributions, view circuit-specific impact zones with SVG maps, and analyze team-level gains/losses.
*   **Operational Connectivity**: Ensure the frontend and backend are fully integrated, where the backend handles the heavy machine learning computation in notebooks and the frontend provides a premium, user-friendly interface for result exploration using processed JSON artifacts.
