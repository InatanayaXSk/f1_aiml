# 4. Methodology

The methodology for this project is built upon a rigorous, end-to-end data science pipeline, as documented in our `src` and `notebooks` directory summaries, that translates raw racing telemetry into future-state projections. The process begins with the automated retrieval of multi-season session data (2022-2025) via the **FastF1 API**, where race results and environmental conditions are extracted and persisted to a local CSV cache by the `data_loader.py` module. Following data acquisition, we implement a comprehensive feature engineering stage in the `02_feature_engineering.ipynb` notebook, which utilizes the `features.py` module to construct a high-dimensional matrix of 25 curated features including rolling driver form (position and points over a 5-race window), track archetypes derived by the `s_frontend/pathGen.py` script, and regulation-sensitive parameters like electrical power ratios. This feature matrix is then used to train an **XGBoost regression model**, selected for its ability to capture non-linear interactions, achieving a baseline Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately 2.1 positions as shown in `03_monte_carlo_sim.ipynb`. To simulate the 2026 environment, we apply a series of technical multipliers via the `regulation_transform.py` module—scaling the electrical power ratio by 3.33x and reducing aerodynamic drag by 30%. Finally, the system executes a **Monte Carlo simulation** consisting of 2,000 iterations per race; in each iteration, Gaussian noise is injected into "soft" features (5% for form, 10% for weather) by the `monte_carlo.py` engine, allowing the model to predict a distribution of outcomes that quantify the inherent volatility and competitive sensitivity of the upcoming 2026 regulations, which are ultimately visualized through the interactive dashboards in the `frontend/` directory.
